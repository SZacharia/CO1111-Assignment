    Our team members are: Stavros Zacharia, Ioannis Panteli

    We managed to do a good work for two people team. We have a small amount of commits on GitHub due to some issues we
    had about pushing on it and we started pushing after a meeting that we had with Mr. Nearchos who gave as some
    solutions. Furthermore, we had many meetings in order to complete the assignment at this point. Stavros was
    responsible mainly for Javascript and helped with the design. Ioannis was responsible about design and helped with
    Javascript. We helped each other whenever we had difficulties.
